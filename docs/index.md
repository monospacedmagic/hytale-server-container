# 🐳 Hytale Docker Server

Welcome to the official documentation for the **`freudend/hytale-server`**. This project provides a high-performance, containerized environment for hosting Hytale servers with ease, featuring automated binary management cross-platform and Pterodactyl support.

To get the most performance out of your server, I suggest taking a look at the [optimizations](./optimizations.md) page!
