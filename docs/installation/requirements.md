## 📋 Requirements & Licensing

Before deploying the container, ensure your environment meets the following hardware and licensing requirements.

### 🔑 Hytale License
Because Hytale requires a valid license to access server binaries, this container does not come pre-packaged with the game files.
* **Authentication:** You must provide your Hytale license credentials to the container via environment variables.
