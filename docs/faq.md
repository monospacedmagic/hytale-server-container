## 🕒 My logs don't show the correct date or time.

By default, Docker containers often run in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). To synchronize the server logs with your local time, you must define the `TZ` (Time Zone) environment variable.

### How to Fix
1.  Consult the [List of TZ Database Time Zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
2.  Locate your location in the **"TZ identifier"** column (e.g., `America/New_York` or `Europe/Paris`).
3.  Add the variable to your deployment:

#### Docker CLI
```bash
docker run -e TZ="Europe/Brussels" ...
```
#### Docker Compose
```bash
services:
  hytale:
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Brussels
```
